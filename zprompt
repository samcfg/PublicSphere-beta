We should make sure that moderators only recieve appended attribution tables, where the anonymous ones 1
user_id optional parameter in language? ramafications? 
For entities that have user_id=null, this displays as "deleted" in UI. I think "anonymous" is better. 
● Component libraries:
  - shadcn/ui (headless, customizable,
  Tailwind-based—very popular)
  - Radix UI (primitives, accessibility-focused)
  - Mantine (full-featured, good defaults)
  - Ant Design (enterprise-grade, comprehensive)


We need the same for all other attribution logic, comments and graph 
elements. Currently, userattribution UI and batch attribution calls on graph render do 
not distinguish between ownership when the element is anonymous. That is a critical 
mistake. still planning, how can we make this is_own=True; is_anonymous=True case work 
with graph elements as well as it does in your comments case? scan the relevant 
parameters within files.
