We are working on the language.py. read the <devlog.md> for details. We
  are expanding and testing the soon-to-be api. If you understand the use,
  help me design two more functions in language, a edit_node() and
  edit_edge() function. How should we design these functions to make it
  easiest. Eventually from the UI, users will edit text in text boxes.
  should we have a different function for every field within these
  node/edges? We could alternatively have a compound function that takes a
  list of things to edit as part of the input. Thinking about the eventual
  use as an API, what makes most sense?
