Since cytoscape is much more limited then the rest of the react components, we'll use this to clrearly differentiate the graph from other site elements stylistically. This will signal to users the public permenance of the graph, and provide an ethos of lasting respectability, constrasted to the JS components. 
#### Graph design:
- Old school serffif fonts, 
- background with puply-paper texture. 
#### Site design overall
- Incorporate engineer diagram look?
- Retrofuturism? 

Journal: 
The DOM elements now map to cytoscapes coordinates directly, their position isn't tracked by react for now. I will use the user's cursor if I want to track positions of buttons on-click. 
Background shifts when each node does. Cool effect?

Emerging pattern: The borders of elements are the vibrant part.
