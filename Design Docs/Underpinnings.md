This is a tool for non-formal, pragmatic logic. While formal logic is deductive, relying on symbolic logic-crunching to generate valid argumentation, PublicSphere's syntax is simple, immediately readable, and tries to generate sound logic, sacrificing strict symbolic validity for inductive, *defeasible* (falsifiable) argumentation. In large argument maps, there may be sections of purely deductive reasoning, but for the sake of a unified design, formal logic is not used there, and it is up to users to describe their arguments clearly in connection notes and claim content. 
As far as ratings, I have had the idea that claims should not be manually rated, rather their ratings are generated as a compounding of source and connection ratings (perhaps with some algorithm that weights more heavily on sources, since there may be more or less of them, or weights sources and the overall chain of connections between the source and the claim in some ratio)? That design is subject to more thought. 
As far as circular reasoning, I think the creation of a circular connection should be banned. It is logically incongruous, and it short-circuits the calculation of claim ratings. 

  H1-Revised: "The claim-source-connection schema captures the structure of
  informal evidential reasoning as theorized in Toulmin's model and
  contemporary argumentation theory (van Eemeren, Walton). It supports
  defeasible, prima facie reasoning more characteristic of everyday and
  scientific argumentation than formal deductive validity."

  H2: "All arguments can be approximately represented in this schema if we
  accept:
  1. Loss of modal distinctions (necessity/contingency)
  2. Loss of probabilistic precision (unless Bayesian extensions are added)
  3. Implicit warrants must be made explicit in connections
  4. Rebuttals/defeaters are modeled as counter-claims rather than
  defeat-relations"

  H3: "The schema's philosophical foundation lies in:
  - Informal logic (Toulmin, Walton, Govier): argument as dialogical
  justification
  - Epistemological foundationalism: sources ground claims (but note: your
  graph structure also supports coherentism if circular justification is
  allowed)
  - Pragma-dialectics (van Eemeren & Grootendorst): argumentation as
  resolution of difference of opinion"
