# Making the Graph Dynamic
## 1. Adding quotes to connections
for connections, I want there to be an optional quote field, where users can input a quote from a SOURCE node. only works when that node is the source, both in terms of our custom node types, and in the sense that the connection comes FROM it. 
## 2. Splitting/elaborating connections into component arguments
Sometimes, an argument is written initially in an oversimilified way, so that reworking the overall number of connections and nodes is necessary. This is argument refactoring - restructuring for clarity without changing substance.

## 3.Reporting 
Button along with the others, flag, nothing fancy. simple modal, wire it to django modding. 

# Making the Graph pretty
## 4. Zooming and panning
All potentially based in an @viewport.jsx file. Premise:
### A. acvitve on node click
if that node is relatively out of view, pan to bring that node closer to the center of the screen, therefore revealing its dependencies. 
### B. Now, when clicking the "add node" button 
on onclicknode DOM, two new boxes appear that may be out of frame initially. I want the frame to move itself in a smooth pan so that those become visible.

## 8. Merge NodeBox and StandaloneNodeCreationModal.jsx
  Shared Elements

  Both components use identical:
  - Form structure: Node type buttons (Claim/Evidence), content textarea, source title/URL fields
  - CSS classes: .node-creation-field, .node-creation-label, .node-creation-type-btn, .node-creation-input,
  .node-creation-textarea
  - Validation logic: Title required for sources, content required for all
  - Error handling: Duplicate detection for claims (exact/similar), sources (URL/title), with formatted error
  displays
  - API integration: Same createClaim() / createSource() calls

  Key Differences
  1. Component Pattern

  - NodeBox: Controlled component. Parent manages state, passes down via props
    - Used in compound connections (multiple NodeBoxes stacked)
    - Supports index prop for "Node 2", "Node 3" labels
    - Optional showControls prop (only first box shows buttons)
  - StandaloneNodeCreationModal: Owns all state
    - Self-contained modal with backdrop (<div className="modal-backdrop">)
    - Single-purpose: create one standalone node

  ~200 lines of duplicate logic exist between the two:
  1. Form field rendering (title/URL/content inputs)
  2. Validation checks (title required for sources)
  3. Error handling (duplicate detection, title_required)
  4. API call patterns
