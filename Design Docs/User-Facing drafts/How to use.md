# How to use the site
This is a meta analysis website, designed to capture collective knowledge in a readable frame. 
**When you approach a topic**
*If you're new to the topic*, a graph view is ideal to get aquainted with the scope and main concerns. *If youre an expert*, it can help fill in blanks in specific subdomains, reveal common counter-arguments, and lets you share your stance, no matter how contravercial providing quick feedback for areas that you are developing. 

# Notes for readers
This graph interface is read as an argument map. 
*Claims* are stand-alone statements. Click on one to see all the other claims that have been connected to it, supporting or contradicting it: its argument map. Claims are designed to be modular, and can be part of many different arguments, even though they are usually encountered in the context of a given train of thought. So, when commenting on and rating them, only rate the actual content of the statement itself, or its usefulness, as a stand-alone. If the claim looks good but it is used wrong in the argument context, you have a problem with the way it is connected. 
*Connections* are the links that hold the argument together. They can be obvious, so represented as "supports" or "contradicts". But arguments tend to be more interesting than that, so users write explinations. Read these explinations closely, rate them, and comment so that your thought is stored and can be utilized to make the argument better. 
*Ratings and comments* are the most social elements of the site. Make them with care, and read them with caution. 

# Philosophical Disclaimers
- This site's design is fundementally pragmatic, meaning that in terms of ultimate epistemology, we do not care about the fact that induction cannot support itself. Induction can provide valid social reasons for establishing shared truth, and that is sufficient.
- The site is a tool for reasoning. Non-rational statements like "x is a good painter" is not a demonstrable with these tools, but of course, for cases like this the tools of this site simply are the wrong tool.
