# ***6\. Content Liability and Safe Harbor Protection***

## ***6.1 Platform Design Philosophy***

***Truth-Seeking Environment** PublicSphere SourceExchange employs systematic mechanisms including source requirements, referrer validation, and community moderation designed to create environmental pressures favoring accurate information. These constitute platform design choices rather than content verification services.*

***Selection Pressure Approach** Like evolutionary selection, our platform mechanisms work gradually and contingently. They do not guarantee outcomes but create structural incentives for source quality, accurate attribution, and evidence-based discourse over time.*

***Design vs. Verification Distinction** Platform features may help surface higher-quality information through user interaction patterns, but this represents systematic design choices, not editorial judgment or content verification by PublicSphere.*

## ***6.2 Content Accuracy Disclaimers***

***No Content Warranty** PublicSphere does not verify, warrant, endorse, or guarantee the accuracy of:*

* *User-contributed sources, citations, or evidence claims*  
* *Research validity or methodological soundness of linked studies*  
* *Factual accuracy of user discussions or analysis*  
* *Completeness or currentness of source material*  
* *Conclusions drawn by users from presented evidence*

***Information Quality Indicators** Platform features including source ratings, referrer validation, and community feedback provide information about user perspectives and source accessibility, not PublicSphere endorsement of content accuracy.*

***Independent Verification Responsibility** Users must independently assess source reliability, verify factual claims, and exercise critical judgment about information encountered on the platform.*

## ***6.3 Safe Harbor and Liability Protection***

***User-Generated Content Disclaimer** PublicSphere operates as a platform for user-generated discussions. We are not liable for content created, shared, or linked by users, including:*

* *Source materials submitted by users*  
* *User interpretations, analysis, or commentary*  
* *External website content accessed through user-provided links*  
* *Academic or research conclusions drawn by users*  
* *Personal experiences or anecdotal evidence shared by users*

***Third-Party Content** Links to external sources, references to published materials, and user-submitted citations connect to content controlled by third parties. We disclaim responsibility for external content accuracy, availability, or compliance with applicable laws.*

***Content Moderation vs. Content Endorsement** Content moderation decisions (including warnings, removals, or account restrictions) reflect platform operational needs and community standards, not judgment about factual accuracy or source validity.*

## ***6.4 Professional Advice and Specialized Information***

***Medical Information Disclaimer** Health-related discussions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute medical advice. Users should consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions and not rely on platform discussions for health-related choices.*

***Legal Information Disclaimer** Legal discussions reflect general information and personal perspectives, not professional legal advice. Users should consult qualified attorneys for legal guidance specific to their circumstances.*

***Financial Information Disclaimer** Investment, economic, or financial discussions represent general information and user opinions, not professional financial advice. Users should consult qualified financial advisors before making financial decisions.*

***Emergency Information** Platform discussions are not appropriate for emergency situations requiring immediate professional intervention. Users experiencing emergencies should contact appropriate emergency services or professional help.*

## ***6.5 Content Review and Removal Policies***

***Reactive Content Review** We review content reactively in response to user reports, legal notices, or identified platform violations. Content review does not constitute comprehensive monitoring or systematic fact-checking.*

***Removal Criteria** Content may be removed for:*

* *Violations of platform terms or community standards*  
* *Legal compliance requirements (copyright, defamation, court orders)*  
* *Technical platform security or functionality needs*  
* *Spam, harassment, or abusive behavior*

***Preservation of Discussion Context** When removing content for policy violations, we may preserve discussion structure and attribution indicators to maintain thread continuity while removing specific problematic content.*

---

*This section establishes PublicSphere's role as a discussion platform while clarifying that systematic design choices to favor quality information do not constitute content verification or editorial endorsement.*

# ***7\. Referrer-Based Access Model***

## ***7.1 Access System Overview***

***HTTP Referrer Validation** PublicSphere SourceExchange uses HTTP referrer headers to validate that users accessing article discussions arrived through legitimate publisher links. This system enables discussions tied to specific published sources while respecting publisher content and traffic patterns.*

***Publisher Relationship Framework** Access to article discussions depends on users arriving through valid referrer links from cooperating publishers. This system does not grant rights to published content itself, only to participate in platform discussions about those sources.*

***Technical Implementation** The referrer validation system operates automatically based on technical protocols. Individual access determinations are made through technical validation, not editorial judgment about user qualifications or source quality.*

## ***7.2 Access Rights and Limitations***

***Granted Access Rights** Valid referrer validation grants users:*

* *Ability to participate in discussions linked to the specific article*  
* *Access to existing discussion threads for that article*  
* *Voting and commenting privileges within those discussions*  
* *Ability to reference and cite the validated source in platform discussions*

***Access Scope Limitations** Referrer validation does not grant:*

* *Rights to reproduce, redistribute, or republish original article content*  
* *Access to discussions about other articles without separate validation*  
* *Platform-wide access to restricted features or content*  
* *Any ownership or licensing rights to the original published material*

***Access Persistence** Once validated through legitimate referrer links, users retain access to specific article discussions unless:*

* *Publisher relationships change requiring access modification*  
* *Technical issues prevent continued validation*  
* *User account status changes affect platform participation*  
* *Legal requirements mandate access restriction*

## ***7.3 Publisher Relationship Changes***

***Dynamic Publisher Cooperation** Publisher relationships and cooperation levels may change based on mutual agreement, technical capabilities, and publisher business decisions. Users acknowledge that referrer access depends on ongoing publisher cooperation.*

***Access Modification Procedures** When publisher relationships change, we will:*

* *Provide notice to affected users when operationally feasible*  
* *Maintain existing discussions where technically possible*  
* *Offer alternative access methods when available and appropriate*  
* *Preserve discussion context and user contributions where legally permissible*

***No Guaranteed Access** Users have no guaranteed right to specific article access independent of publisher cooperation and technical validation systems. Platform access depends on continuing publisher relationships and technical functionality.*

## ***7.4 Alternative Access Methods***

***Technical Issue Resolution** When legitimate users cannot access discussions due to technical problems with referrer validation, we may provide alternative verification methods subject to available resources and publisher agreements.*

***Educational and Research Access** For users with legitimate educational or research needs, we may consider alternative access methods on a case-by-case basis, balancing publisher relationships with academic access principles.*

***Request Process** Users requiring alternative access should contact publicspherestaff@gmail.com with:*

* *Specific article or discussion they need to access*  
* *Description of the technical issue preventing normal access*  
* *Explanation of their legitimate interest in the discussion*  
* *Alternative verification information when available*

***No Guaranteed Accommodation** Alternative access methods are provided at platform discretion and subject to technical limitations, publisher agreements, and available resources. We cannot guarantee alternative access in all circumstances.*

## ***7.5 Technical Dependencies and Limitations***

***Browser and Network Dependencies** Referrer validation depends on proper browser configuration, network settings, and HTTP protocol compliance. Some browser privacy settings, network configurations, or security software may interfere with referrer transmission.*

***Publisher Technical Changes** Changes to publisher website structure, URL patterns, or technical implementation may affect referrer validation. We work to maintain compatibility but cannot guarantee seamless access during publisher technical transitions.*

***Platform Evolution** As the platform develops, referrer validation methods may be enhanced or modified to improve functionality, security, or publisher compatibility. Users will be notified of significant changes affecting access methods.*

---

*The referrer-based access model enables source-linked discussions while respecting publisher content and maintaining technical scalability for platform operation.*

# ***8\. Evidence Standards and User Responsibility***

## ***8.1 Platform Approach to Information Quality***

***Environmental Design for Quality** PublicSphere employs structural mechanisms including source requirements, referrer validation, and community evaluation to create systematic pressures favoring well-sourced, accurately attributed information over time.*

***Process vs. Outcome Distinction** These design choices establish processes that encourage quality information sharing but do not guarantee specific outcomes or constitute platform verification of factual accuracy.*

***User-Driven Evaluation** Information quality assessment occurs through user interaction, community feedback, and transparent source attribution rather than centralized fact-checking or editorial verification by platform administration.*

## ***8.2 User Responsibility for Information Accuracy***

***Independent Verification Obligation** Users are responsible for:*

* *Independently verifying the accuracy of sources they cite or reference*  
* *Exercising critical judgment about information reliability and source credibility*  
* *Distinguishing between established facts, ongoing research, and personal opinions*  
* *Acknowledging limitations in their own knowledge or expertise when relevant*

***Source Quality Assessment** Users should evaluate sources considering factors such as:*

* *Publisher reputation and editorial standards*  
* *Author qualifications and potential conflicts of interest*  
* *Publication type (peer-reviewed research, news reporting, opinion pieces)*  
* *Recency and relevance to the discussion context*  
* *Consistency with other credible sources on the same topic*

***Correction and Update Responsibility** Users should promptly correct or clarify their contributions when:*

* *Errors in source citation or attribution are identified*  
* *More current or accurate information becomes available*  
* *Other users identify legitimate problems with source reliability*  
* *Original sources are retracted, corrected, or updated*

## ***8.3 Community Standards for Evidence and Discussion***

***Good Faith Engagement** Users should engage with evidence and arguments in good faith by:*

* *Addressing substantive points raised by other users*  
* *Acknowledging valid corrections or counterarguments*  
* *Avoiding misrepresentation of sources or other users' positions*  
* *Distinguishing between disagreement with conclusions and problems with evidence quality*

***Source Attribution Standards** When referencing sources, users should:*

* *Provide sufficient information for others to locate and verify sources*  
* *Distinguish between direct quotes, paraphrases, and their own analysis*  
* *Acknowledge when sources contain preliminary, disputed, or limited findings*  
* *Indicate when citing sources that may not be freely accessible to all users*

***Intellectual Honesty** Users should maintain intellectual honesty by:*

* *Not selectively citing sources while ignoring contradictory evidence*  
* *Acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties in available evidence*  
* *Avoiding claims that exceed what their sources actually demonstrate*  
* *Distinguishing between correlation and causation in research discussions*

## ***8.4 Misinformation and Source Reliability***

***Reporting Problematic Sources** Users may report sources that appear to be:*

* *Fabricated, falsified, or substantially misleading*  
* *Misrepresented in terms of their actual content or conclusions*  
* *From sources known to repeatedly publish inaccurate information*  
* *Potentially harmful if accepted as reliable information*

***Platform Response to Reports** When problematic sources are reported, we may:*

* *Review the reported content and source material when resources permit*  
* *Add warnings or context indicators to discussions containing disputed sources*  
* *Remove content that violates platform standards or poses safety concerns*  
* *Facilitate discussion about source reliability while preserving user access to evaluate evidence*

***Distinguishing Opinion from Misinformation** Platform responses focus on clear factual inaccuracies or source misrepresentation rather than disagreements over interpretation, methodology, or conclusions drawn from legitimate sources.*

## ***8.5 Research and Academic Integrity***

***Academic Discussion Standards** Users engaging in research-oriented discussions should:*

* *Properly cite sources according to appropriate academic standards*  
* *Acknowledge limitations in methodology or sample size when relevant*  
* *Distinguish between peer-reviewed research and other forms of evidence*  
* *Respect intellectual property rights in their citations and references*

***Transparency About Qualifications** While users are not required to reveal personal information, they should avoid misrepresenting:*

* *Their educational background or professional expertise when relevant to discussions*  
* *Their relationship to research they cite (e.g., if they authored or funded studies)*  
* *Their conflicts of interest that might bias their source selection or interpretation*

***Collaborative Knowledge Building** Platform discussions aim to facilitate collaborative evaluation of evidence and sources rather than definitive resolution of complex research questions.*

* *Content-only export with minimal context (simpler format, may lose some discussion context)*  
* *Custom export focusing on specific data categories or time periods*

***Technical Infrastructure Constraints** As a developing platform with limited resources, export processing capabilities may vary based on:*

* *Current server capacity and technical infrastructure*  
* *Complexity of the requested data export*  
* *Number of concurrent export requests being processed*  
* *Available engineering time for custom export requirements*

## ***9.4 Data Retention After Export***

***Platform Data Retention** Providing data export does not automatically remove user data from platform systems. Users must separately request account deletion if they wish to remove data from active platform operation.*

***Discussion Integrity Balance** Even after data export, user contributions may remain visible on the platform to preserve:*

* *Discussion thread continuity and context*  
* *Source citation chains and evidence references*  
* *Community conversation flow and academic value*  
* *Other users' ability to understand discussion context*

***Post-Export Modifications** After receiving data export, users retain the ability to:*

* *Edit or delete individual contributions through normal platform mechanisms*  
* *Request account deletion with standard data removal procedures*  
* *Continue platform participation with exported data serving as personal backup*

## ***9.5 Data Export Limitations and Disclaimers***

***Best Effort Standard** Data export is provided on a best-effort basis reflecting current platform capabilities and resource constraints. We cannot guarantee:*

* *Complete capture of all user data in all technical formats*  
* *Preservation of complex formatting or interactive elements*  
* *Inclusion of data that may be technically challenging to extract*  
* *Export of data that has been removed for legal or policy reasons*

***No Guaranteed Timelines** While we target 30-day processing for standard requests, actual timelines may vary based on request complexity, technical challenges, and available resources.*

***Legal and Safety Limitations** Some data may be excluded from export due to:*

* *Legal requirements to preserve certain records*  
* *Safety concerns related to harassment or abuse cases*  
* *Technical limitations in extracting specific data types*  
* *Privacy protections for other users' information*

***One-Person Operation Acknowledgment** Users requesting data export acknowledge that processing is performed by limited technical staff with competing priorities including platform development, security, and user support.*

---

*Data export rights balance user control over personal information with technical realities of platform operation and the need to preserve discussion integrity for the broader community.*

# ***10\. Business Model Evolution and Organizational Transition***

## ***10.1 Platform Development and Business Model Changes***

***Experimental Platform Status** PublicSphere SourceExchange operates as an experimental platform exploring evidence-based discussion models. Business model, organizational structure, and feature priorities may evolve based on user needs, technical capabilities, and sustainability requirements.*

***Feature Modification During Evolution** As the platform and its underlying business model develop, we may:*

* *Modify existing features to better serve user needs or improve sustainability*  
* *Add new functionality that enhances evidence-based discussion capabilities*  
* *Discontinue features that prove technically unsustainable or legally problematic*  
* *Adjust service levels to match available resources and organizational capacity*

***User Notification for Significant Changes** Material changes affecting core platform functionality (referrer access, discussion participation, source submission) will be communicated according to the procedures outlined in Section 1.5.*

## ***10.2 Nonprofit Transition Provisions***

***Organizational Evolution Path** PublicSphere may transition from current experimental operation to nonprofit organizational structure to better serve the platform's educational and research mission.*

***Data and Service Continuity During Transition** During any nonprofit transition:*

* *User data and existing content will be preserved and transferred according to privacy policy requirements*  
* *Existing user accounts and access rights will be maintained where technically feasible*  
* *Core platform functionality will continue with minimal disruption to ongoing discussions*  
* *Terms of service will be updated to reflect new organizational structure with appropriate notice*

***User Rights Preservation** Throughout organizational transitions, users retain:*

* *Ownership of their original contributions to platform discussions*  
* *Access rights to discussions they have legitimately joined through referrer validation*  
* *Data export rights according to the procedures established in Section 9*  
* *Protection under privacy policies and data handling commitments*

## ***10.3 Resource Scaling and Service Evolution***

***Resource-Constrained Development** As an early-stage platform, current service levels reflect available resources and one-person operational constraints. Service capabilities may improve as organizational resources and technical infrastructure develop.*

***Scaling Acknowledgments** Users acknowledge that current platform operation involves:*

* *Best-effort response times for user support and technical issues*  
* *Limited availability for complex custom requests or extensive troubleshooting*  
* *Development priorities focused on core functionality rather than comprehensive feature sets*  
* *Resource allocation decisions based on platform sustainability and user safety*

***Service Level Improvements** As resources permit, we anticipate improving:*

* *Response times for user support and appeals processes*  
* *Technical infrastructure reliability and performance*  
* *Feature development and platform functionality*  
* *Accessibility and language support capabilities*

## ***10.4 Business Model Transparency and User Impact***

***Current Revenue Model** PublicSphere currently operates without direct user fees or advertising revenue. Platform operation depends on volunteer effort and minimal infrastructure costs.*

***Potential Future Revenue Sources** Future sustainability may involve:*

* *Optional user contributions or donations to support platform operation*  
* *Grants from academic institutions or research organizations interested in evidence-based discussion*  
* *Partnerships with educational institutions that align with platform values*  
* *Technical consulting or licensing related to evidence-based discussion platform development*

***User Rights During Revenue Model Changes** Any future revenue model changes will:*

* *Maintain focus on evidence-based discussion rather than advertising-driven content*  
* *Preserve core platform accessibility without creating barriers to legitimate academic or educational use*  
* *Provide user notification and choice regarding participation in any fee-based services*  
* *Respect existing user rights and data ownership regardless of revenue model changes*

## ***10.5 Platform Discontinuation and Data Preservation***

***Service Discontinuation Procedures** If platform operation becomes unsustainable, we will:*

* *Provide at least 90 days advance notice when circumstances permit*  
* *Enable users to export their contributions according to established procedures*  
* *Make reasonable efforts to preserve academic and research value of existing discussions*  
* *Consider transfer of platform operations to appropriate academic or research organizations*

***Data Archival Considerations** For discussions with significant academic or research value, we may:*

* *Explore partnerships with academic institutions for data preservation*  
* *Consider contributing discussion archives to appropriate research databases*  
* *Facilitate researcher access to aggregated, anonymized discussion data*  
* *Respect user privacy and content ownership rights in any archival decisions*

***User Responsibilities During Discontinuation** During any discontinuation process, users should:*

* *Request data export promptly to ensure access to personal contributions*  
* *Save important sources or references for personal research use*  
* *Consider alternative platforms for continuing evidence-based discussions*  
* *Respect other users' rights and platform operational needs during transition*
