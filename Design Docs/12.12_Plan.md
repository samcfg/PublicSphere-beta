The "NEOPLAN" is fairly outdated, I'm working off based on features that I find necessary via testing. 
# 1. Editing Nodes
I found the need to do that, but immediately find it problematic. The owner of the node (isown=true) controls the editing capability. However, if a node can gain rating based on one meaning, then the meaning is changed, that is a serious contradiction. Versioning is a bandaid there. Therefore I think that there should be an edit suggestion functionality that is ultimately used more often. This is separate from a report function. 
Suggested modifications should be included in a sidebar in the node page. Community support should be given by ratings. From these suggested modifications, should come forks, and edits. 
## Forking
Automatic with suggestion, (creating a standalone node that is really only reachable through search), or suggest -> fork proccess?
**Prompt:** Modify? Modifications are for improving the overall quality of a node's writing, for arguments about its content, rate, comment, or # 2.Reporting if problematic (tos)
**Prompt: modification -> Fork**: Do you want to make this suggested modification a node for others to use? 
- This may solve the potential problem of users adding dualing nodes instead of arguing with contradictory nodes.  

# 2.Reporting 
Button along with the others, flag, nothing fancy. simple modal, wire it to django modding. 

# 3. Zooming and panning
All potentially based in an @viewport.jsx file. Premise:
## A. acvitve on node click
if that node is relatively out of view, pan to bring that node closer to the center of the screen, therefore revealing its dependencies. 
## B. Now, when clicking the "add node" button 
on onclicknode DOM, two new boxes appear that may be out of frame initially. I want the frame to move itself in a smooth pan so that those become visible. 

# 4. CreateNodeModal Revamp
Change font, make animation, make lines. 


# 5. Consolidate fonts and colors

# 6. Homepage revamp

# 7. Merge NodeBox and StandaloneNodeCreationModal.jsx
  Shared Elements

  Both components use identical:
  - Form structure: Node type buttons (Claim/Evidence), content textarea, source title/URL fields
  - CSS classes: .node-creation-field, .node-creation-label, .node-creation-type-btn, .node-creation-input,
  .node-creation-textarea
  - Validation logic: Title required for sources, content required for all
  - Error handling: Duplicate detection for claims (exact/similar), sources (URL/title), with formatted error
  displays
  - API integration: Same createClaim() / createSource() calls

  Key Differences
  1. Component Pattern

  - NodeBox: Controlled component. Parent manages state, passes down via props
    - Used in compound connections (multiple NodeBoxes stacked)
    - Supports index prop for "Node 2", "Node 3" labels
    - Optional showControls prop (only first box shows buttons)
  - StandaloneNodeCreationModal: Owns all state
    - Self-contained modal with backdrop (<div className="modal-backdrop">)
    - Single-purpose: create one standalone node

  ~200 lines of duplicate logic exist between the two:
  1. Form field rendering (title/URL/content inputs)
  2. Validation checks (title required for sources)
  3. Error handling (duplicate detection, title_required)
  4. API call patterns
