Look into alternative "computational argumentation" from Claude conversation saved; compare and contrast
	- Watching [Dealing with Uncertain Arguments in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdsFlLudLjo&t=1123s)
		- Very similar graphs to my own [eg](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07489), but 
			- rarely do they have verbose connections. Usually supports or attacks. 
			- Often deal with probability, but probability *of what* is not too well defined.  truth? Acceptance? **Publicsphere's metric of popular acceptance is a good, more demonstrable metric to some extent.**
		- In order to make this site computation food, we'd need **assignment of probabilities to nodes**, which is a discrete computational step.  
			- more expensive than the subsequent logic crunching
			- Problematic, as bias from wherever is inevitable.
Then I'll use that as a jumping off point to make types of sources. 
- Potential look back/foreward at SourceExchange
- Backend Adjustment
