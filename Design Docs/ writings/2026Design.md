The ongoing process of social inductive reasoning, the deliberation necessary for a democracy, can be facilitated by tools. The tools we have are not close to optimal, and digital media give more opportunity. So much so, that from the perspective of political theory, the viability of applied democracy can increase with projects like PublicSphere. 
PublicSphere is a meta analysis reading and writing tool that abstracts and makes plain the deliberation process, making it comprehensible and participatory. Its core is a database made up of user contributions of arguments, dense with connections as you read, and explore the argument structure itself, and with that same visual language vote on the structural minutia of the argument for future readers, expand the graph with new thought paths, and get feedback on them. Claims become explicitly linked to observations and logical thought, and therefore not taken on faith unless a user is participating in bad faith. 
The core of the website is the model of argumentation, stored in a graph database: nodes and interconnections between nodes. 
To this end, the nodes in the website are split into "claims", and "sources". 
These things make up the website's graph database, which is a collection of these nodes and connections, which are alltogether stored as a giant argument map. 
Users select a claim to examine, and the website extracts its context from the argument map: the claim itself, the connections leading up to it, the nodes those connections originate from, and recursively downward until reaching the bottom layer of sources. This context is a subgraph showing the complete chain of reasoning that supports (or contradicts) the claim. 
Users view contexts with a graph-database visualization software called cytoscape, appearing as an actual hierarchical argument map with text-box nodes and arrow connections between them.
Claims nodes have text in them, declaritive sentences. 
Sources must reference some kind of empyrical evidence. For published evidence, it ideally includes a web hyperlink to an article, along with citations like author and publisher, but other forms of evidence, like personal testimony are also encouraged. Primary evidence is best for this kind of argument mapping, but synthetic sources may be added too, perhaps in comments sections, Perhaps users could add them best by hilighting a large section of an argument map and adding a source which makes the same argument. Useful for natural flow between map and reading. 
Connections contain text, which is required to explain how the two nodes connect, inductive or deductively. That way, when reading the graph, users can follow the argument between nodes. 
More than this, connections must be one of several types: **"supports", "contradicts", "and", "nand"**. "Supports" and "and" mean that the nodes give justification for the above claim, while "contradicts" and "nand" do the opposite. "and" and "nand" are compound connections, meaning that they require at least two nodes to justify their conclusion. For example, a connection that states: "if Bill was both in that room at that time, and bought his watch after that time, then he could not have checked that watch in that room at that time". Which requires a source for the time that he was in the room, and the time that he bought the watch. To use compound connections, users must understand independent disjuncts vs. necessary conjunction. 
When reading the graph, after logging in, users can rate the sources and connections in **0-100 scale**, which means rating the factuality and logic respectively. That means connections must contain logical warrant, and rating depends on articulation, when contested. Connections are rated on the quality of the reasoning step—both whether the logic is sound AND whether sources are appropriately applied to reach the conclusion. There is an editing system for nodes and edges when questions arise, and a way to suggest the addition of an intermediate claim node when the connection contains an implicit assertion within the connection that needs scrutiny, therefore articulation. 
Each node and claim has a comments section where users can give reasons for their ratings. Comments also provide space for nonstructured knowledge, opinions and normative statements that make up lifeworld dependency. Users can reference sources; context-giving meta-analyses here. 
The claims cannot be rated directly. A **claim's rating** is constructed by a combination of the sources and connections that lead up to it. Thus, rating a claim because it "feels" right is impossible: a claim is only as good as the reasons for it. The algorithm to calculate claim's rating is not invented yet. Contradictory connections apply a (-) sign to all the ratings that lead up to it, so that a well supported contradiction severly effects the rating. Proposed claim rating algorithm core principles are: 1. Within argument paths: Multiply source strength × connection validity (a chain's strength requires both strong evidence AND strong logic) 2. Compound connections: Product of all parent inputs (conjunction is only as strong as combined reliability) 3. Multiple independent paths: Probabilistic reinforcement (two 70% arguments → 91% combined, not 140%) 4. Contradictions: Subtract aggregated contradiction strength from support strength
Logged in users can also create nodes, and connect them to the existing graph, or connect two previously unconnected nodes. They cannot create circular reasoning (a potential circle between connections is detected and causes creation to be rejected), and sources are leaf nodes to the argument map. 
There are social features like user reputation and moderation of user activity (though not for the content of their genuine thought), which will help support the health of the contributing community and argument map as a whole. Moderation must assure equal access to discourse, and for this epistemic-analytical tool, must remove normative claim nodes. Ultimately wikipedia is the best model for this kind of collaborative content creation.
